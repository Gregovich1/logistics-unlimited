To set up your development environment:
1. Make sure you have Git installed. (Update) You should also install Node.js.
2. Download the repository and open in project in Visual Studio Code.
3. Open the integrated terminal.
4. If using Windows, change the environment from Powershell to Bash.
5. Enter "npm run dev" to start your development server on localhost: 3000
6. Nodemon will listen for changes, so start editing the code. When you refresh localhost: 3000 in your browser, the changes should be reflected.
